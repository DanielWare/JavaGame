# JavaGame
JavaGame was created in OOP class for final project


Cover Page:
•	Course Title: CMSC 3103 Object Oriented Software Design & Construction
•	Semester: Fall 2015
•	Name:
•	UCO ID:
•	Major (Computer Science, CS – Applied, CS – Information Science, Software Engineering)
o	If you are in CS minor, write your major and CS minor.
o	If you are an exchange student, write Exchange student.
o	If none of the above, write your major.

 
Section I: User Stories

In this section, write User Stories in detail based on your finished program.
•	Use the same format of User Story that you used in the proposal.
•	Revise this section based on the finished program; delete if you did not implement.
•	Underline words that you chose and implemented as classes.

 
Section II: CRC Cards

Using the same format of CRC cards, write CRC cards for
•	All classes and interfaces based on the finished program.

 
Section III: UML Class Diagram

Draw one single UML diagram based on the finished project.
•	Write class names only; no instance variables or methods. This implies that the rectangle should not have any partitions.
•	Note that no hand-drawn diagram is accepted.
•	Try to fit the whole UML into one page.

 
Section IV: Implementation of Required Features

(1) Implementation of One Additional Enemy Type

Explain in detail attributes and behaviors of the additional enemy type that you implemented

(2) Destroying Effects of Enemies

Explain in detail the effects you implemented when each enemy is destroyed.

(3) Implementation of the State design pattern for three Enemy types

For each enemy type, explain in detail how you utilized the State pattern (In Section V and VI, you will give UML diagrams and proof. You may refer to them when you explain here in detail.)

(4) Implementation of an additional design pattern

Explain in detail how you utilized this design pattern (In Section V and VI, you will give UML diagrams and proof. You may refer to them when you explain here in detail.)

(5) Implementation of an optional feature

Explain in detail the optional feature you implemented and how you utilized it for the game. If it is an additional design pattern, add it also in Section V and VI as the proof of correct implementation.

(6) New Ideas of the Game

Explain in detail if your game is not directly based on p8; e.g., different enemy types than UFO and Bombs. different behaviors of the main character (Shooter).


 
Section V: UML Diagrams for Design Patterns Implemented

For each design pattern:
•	Draw a UML diagram in detail including attributes (instance variables) and behaviors (methods)
•	Include classes only if they are the participants of the design pattern.
•	Must include relationships and multiplicity based on your finished program.

Note that you need to include 4 or 5 UML diagrams:
•	3 UML diagrams for State pattern implementation for three enemy types.
•	1 UML diagram for an additional design pattern implementation
•	1 more UML diagram if you choose a design pattern as the optional feature.

 
Section VI: Proof for the Correctness of Implemented Design Patterns

For each design pattern (for State pattern, choose one of enemy types), prove that your implementation is correct in terms of (1) the intent of the pattern, (2) the responsibilities of each participant in the pattern.
